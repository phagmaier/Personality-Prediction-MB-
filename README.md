# Personality-Prediction-MB-
Using a vairety of models I attempt to accuratley predict Myers Briggs personality based on input text.
Model trained on a data set of 17350 features (before cleaning and removal).
Used KNN random forrest and logistic regression while comparing/contrasting scores.
Model did not perform well on all 16 personality types so the end focus was on 
the four main types of personality traits, specifically:
1. Introversion(I)/exroversion(E)
2. Intuition(N)/Sensing(S)
3. Thinking (T)/Feeling(F)
4. Judging(J)/Perceiving(P)
